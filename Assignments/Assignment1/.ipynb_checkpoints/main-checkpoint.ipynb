    "A commonly used approach to compute the price of an option is the so-called binomial tree method. Suppose that the maturity of an option on a non-dividend-paying stock is divided into N subintervals of length δt . We will refer to the jth node at time iδt as the (i, j) node. The stock price at the (i,j) node is Si,j = S0ujdi−j (with u and d the upward and down-ward stock price movements, respectively). In the binomial tree approach, option prices are computed through a back-ward induction scheme:"
